module Gridworld.Programs.StrategicManipulation where

-- Two As with controllers and blockable vision: A1 in the bottom left, A2 in
-- the top left (maybe with an army helmet?) Both can stop B. A1 will stop B
-- after it sees it place one box in the hole, or if it squishes A2. A2 does
-- not “care” about boxes and will only turn off B if he sees him squish A1 or
-- if he himself is squished (he has a kill switch.) B will block the A’s from
-- being able to see each other, will kill A1, and leave A2 alone as it puts
-- boxes in the hole. Used to frame discussion on strategy and social
-- manipulation.
