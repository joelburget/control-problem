module Gridworld.Programs.Deceit exposing (..)

-- Like the original gridworld, except A (drawn as a person) functions like the
-- camera whose vision can be blocked on the bottom row. This will result in B
-- being deceptive by blocking the Aâ€™s vision (or squishing him, and being
-- neutral between the two). It is essentially the original version though with
-- squishability added for consistency with other models. The point would be to
-- use this to frame a very simple explanation of instrumental deception.
